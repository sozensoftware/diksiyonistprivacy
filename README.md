This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use our Application.
1. Information We Collect
The Application collects a limited amount of information to function correctly and to improve your experience.
a) Information Collected Automatically:
When you use the Application, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain information, including:

Device Information: Your device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.

The Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.
b) Information You Provide:
We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information like your name or email address to use the Application.
If you choose to purchase "Diksiyonist Premium," the transaction is processed through the App Store by our third-party partner, RevenueCat. We do not receive or store your payment details or Apple ID information.
2. How We Use Your Information

We may share aggregated, anonymized data with these services to help us improve the Application. We do not share personally identifiable information with them.

We value your trust in providing us your information and use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
